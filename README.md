asmCalendar
===========
Damn, I wanted to be all sentimental here. This is my first public piece of code that I'm just throwing out there into the cold dark parts of the internet. I wish it all the best!!! But this will be a new footnote that is the book of my life. A footnote that people will want to flip too because fuck, who doesn't like a nice "This is where it all started" story? 

Oh right, now I remember what I wanted to say. This is an asm program that goes ahead and takes input from the user. It looks like shit, it needs a ton of work.


All it reall does is displays a small assembly calendar that can be used to display any calendar from 2000 to 2100
